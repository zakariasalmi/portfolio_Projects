# Word polarity
# Emotional analysis and word polarity of words using different methods: 
## Understanding the classification of emotions

The importance of word polarity in the classification of emotions The polarity of words, i.e. their orientation
or neutral orientation, plays a crucial role in the classification of emotions. By assigning polarities to the words used in a text, it becomes determine the overall emotional tone of the content, identify the feelings expressed and classify emotions according to their valence. This analysis of word polarity is essential for an accurate classification of emotions
and an in-depth understanding of the emotional content of the data analyzed

# Machine learning approach:

## Supervised machine learning:
These algorithms create a function (or model) based on the input data and use this function to make decisions about how to match future data to an appropriate output
for this approach I used svm

# Deep learning approach:
RNN Algorithm

# Classic Algorithm :
## Probabilistic Classifier:
This classifier assumes that each class is component of the mixture, which provides the probability of sampling a particular
for that component
I create a NB(naive-bayes) MODEL, The Na√Øve Bayes classifier, which calculates the a posteriori probability based on the distribution of words in a document.
