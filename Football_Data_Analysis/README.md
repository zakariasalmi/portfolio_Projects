# Football Data Analysis with python

Welcome to my Football Data Analysis project repository! This project leverages the power of Python, pandas, and the StatsBomb API to extract, manipulate, and analyze football match data. The objective is to showcase how data-driven insights can provide a deeper understanding of football matches, players, and strategies.

Overview
In this repository, I explore several key aspects of football data analysis:

Data Extraction: Using the StatsBomb API to retrieve match data, including event data such as passes, shots, and player movements.
Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Preprocessing the raw data with pandas to ensure it is ready for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Analyzing key metrics like possession, pass success rates, and player performance.
Visualizations: Creating insightful visualizations to highlight important trends and findings.
Key Features
Access to Open Data: StatsBomb provides high-quality, open-source football data.
Detailed Match Insights: Analyze team tactics, player performances, and match outcomes.
Easy to Use: The code is modular and easily adaptable for different analysis needs.
Requirements
To replicate or extend the analysis, youâ€™ll need:

Python =>3.9
